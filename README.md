# Go Utility Package

In This Project i created my own Go module which can be used by anyone and anywhere in their go project.

# How to Import?
Just simply run the following command in your bash terminal

```bash
go get github.com/abhub23/go-utility
```
- This will add the module in your Go project and you can manage it from your go.mod file
#

***For now the package provides very limited functions but with time i will surely add some more func's to it***

**Stay tuned...**

**Give a star if possible ðŸ™ƒ**
